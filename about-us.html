              Bringing Beans All Back Home
            </h2>
            <p class="lead fs-5">
              Our journey begins in 1980s Marrakesh when our founders, Joe Bloggs and Jane Doe, 
              visited the bazaar and were capivated by the aromas and earthy flavours of locally 
              grown, roasted, and brewed coffee. Joe and Jane spent several months travelling to nearby 
              villages and farms to try and identify only the highest quality beans. As our founders
              discovered each village had their own distinct blend, some were choclately, others were bitter
              but all of them were delicious beyond compare. They made it their mission to try and bring 
              these unique wonderful flavours back home to share with their family and friends.

              Dublin Revisited
            </h2>
            <p class="lead px-2 py-2">
              Starting a business isn't easy. And starting a business after spending all your money 
              on a  long trip is nigh impossible. But through sheer determination, will, and a very 
              generous loan from the bank made it a little easier. However coffee competition in Dublin 
              is tough. Very tough. Having set up the cafe the next goal was to find suitable talent 
              who know how to handle the beans. Finding professional barristas who can get the most out 
              of the beans was tricky. To help find those barristas and distinguish Gourmet Roasters from 
              the competition we set up classes to skill up existing employees, provide knowledge to hobbyist
              coffee enjoyers, and to have a little fun for amateurs.

              Being one of the lucky cafes to survive the COVID pandemic, Gourmet Roasters sees a bright future 
              ahead of itself. Recently working with the Fair Trade company to make sure all ingredients 
              in all food and drinks are grown, processed, and transported as ethically as possible. 
              From many parts of the city you the number of cafes visible would outnumber your fingers 
              and toes but we hope that after trying our delicacies and drinks you'll only ever think 
              of one place to get your fix, and that's Gourmet Roasters!
